Password reset
==============

Password reset is initiated by creating a :ref:`Password reset token <token_password>` resource. 
The user will receive an email containing a token, which is to be provided 
alongside with the new password to complete the reset procedure.

Refer to :ref:`"Create a password reset token" <token_password-create>` for details.

Examples
--------

::

    curl -d '{"email": "foo@foo.com"}' \
         -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -X POST \
