    <p>
    {% comment %}Translators: Text/heading of the SSO FAQ (/+faq) {% endcomment %}
    {% blocktrans %}The Launchpad login service has served us well for several years but
Launchpad is not a familiar brand for many Ubuntu users. As Ubuntu
grows, we'll see more and more users who don't understand the connection
between Launchpad and Ubuntu and the new Ubuntu login service is
intended to overcome this problem. It will also enable us to develop
features which are more oriented to Ubuntu users.{% endblocktrans %}

    {% blocktrans %}For now, not much apart from the appearance of the site. We have many plans
for great new features, however, and hope to roll these out once the service
is established. If you have ideas for other features you'd like to see in
{{ brand_description }}, we'd love to hear about them.{% endblocktrans %}
