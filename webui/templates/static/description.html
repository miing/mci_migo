    {% blocktrans %}The goal of this service is to provide a single, central login service
for all Ubuntu-related sites, thus making it more convenient for Ubuntu
users and community members to access information, communicate, and
contribute. This service will replace the existing Launchpad login
service that is currently in use for many Ubuntu-related sites, although
existing Launchpad accounts will continue to work in the new service.{% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
    {% blocktrans %}Over the next few months we will be moving all of the Ubuntu and
Canonical related sites that currently use the Launchpad service to this
service, starting with sites we manage directly and then working with
community site owners to move the community-managed sites.{% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
    {% blocktrans %}Because of the number of existing Ubuntu users who have created accounts
in Launchpad for the purpose of logging into other sites, we have set
both services to share account data during the transition. Launchpad is
in the process of enabling users to log in with an Ubuntu account and,
once completed, this sharing will be removed. This does mean that you
will be able to log into this service and Launchpad with the same
credentials for a while. We realise this is something internet users
have been encouraged to not do but it is a necessary side-effect of the
transition. Doing this ensures you won't lose access to services you've
purchased from us in the past or your account histories in the sites
you've previously visited, as long as you use your existing Launchpad
credentials on this site.{% endblocktrans %}
