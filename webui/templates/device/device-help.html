    {% blocktrans %}We need to remove the device from your account to prevent
    someone using it to gain access to your account.  Please contact us
    immediately to resolve this!  You can reach ISD in the #isd channel on
    IRC, or IS in the #is channel, or phone the IS emergency helpline.

    We can help get a device working again or set you up with some temporary
    tokens to enable you to continue with your work.  If it's not urgent,
    please send email to the ISD Support address as described in the
    <a href="{{2FFAQ}}#Help">2-Factor Auth FAQ</a>
    and someone will get back to you soon.
